        <h1>Where Beauty Begins</h1>
        <p>Every product is crafted with a touch of magic. Deep in our secret atelier, tiny artisans — we like to call
            them the fairies of beauty — delicately mix the finest ingredients, infusing each formula with care, energy,
            and a whisper of nature’s charm.</p>
        <p>From the softest creams to aromatic oils, every bottle carries a story. The fairies ensure that each product
            nourishes, refreshes, and inspires, turning everyday rituals into extraordinary moments.</p>
        <p>Our promise is to combine science, artistry, and a sprinkle of enchantment, creating skincare and haircare
            treasures that are as effective as they are magical. With LUNOR, beauty is not just seen — it is felt,
            experienced, and celebrated.</p>
